    <p class="salmon-river-paragraph">Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was <br>
            given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because <br>
            of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they <br>
            never left.

            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also <br>
            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower <br>
            over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed. <br>
            
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed <br>
            rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the <br>
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all <br>
            summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, <br>
            warmer water more.</p>
    <p class="desolation-paragraph">Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green <br>
            river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert <br>
            scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash <br>
            to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic <br>
            formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater <br>
            opportunities. <br>

            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days <br>
            
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the <br>
            uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>
    <p class="grand-canyon-paragraph">This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. <br>
        You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon. <br>

        Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make <br>
        one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater <br>
        rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. <br>
        
        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon <br>
        are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. <br>
        However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to <br>
        both.</p>
