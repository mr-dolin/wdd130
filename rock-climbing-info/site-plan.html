      <h3>Different Types of Climbing</h3>
      <p>
        Rock climbing has many different avenues in the sport. Some require endurance over strength, while others require short bursts of strength and speed. <br>
<br>
Bouldering: <br>
Bouldering is the most accessible of all the types of climbing. Bouldering can be done by yourself and you only require climbing shoes. Chalk is optional. <br>
Bouldering involves short routes that vary in difficulty. The difficulty range is measured by the letter V followed by a number. The lowest rating is a "V0" while the highest rating <br>
is a "V17." Bouldering routes can be found in indoor climbing gyms, and outdoor climbing routes. An indoor climbing gym will usually max out around V10. Bouldering requires <br>
short bursts of energy with very dynamic movements. Technique will vary depending on difficulty. <br>
<br>
Top Rope: <br>
Top rope is a form of climbing that requires two people. One climbs while the other belays. The climber requires climbing shoes, a harness, and a rope. <br>
The person belaying requires a harness, a rope, a carabiner, and a belay device. Top rope can be found in indoor climbing gyms, and outdoors. A rope is swung over or looped in between <br>
an object located at the top of the wall. The climber will take the end of the rope that is closer to the wall, while the second person (the belayer), will take the rope closer to them. <br>
The rock climber will take the rope between a loop (or more, depending on the harness) and tie what is known as a figure 8 knot. The belayer will attach their belay device to their carabiner. <br>
After which they will guide the rope into their belay device, through the loop (or loops) built into their harness, and finally guide the rope into the other side of their belay device. <br>
As the climber begins scaling the wall, the rope will begin to slack. As the rope slacks, the belayer will pull their rope through their belay device to tighten the slack. <br>
When the climber finishes the route, the belayer will slowly let the rope through the belay device, and the climber will slowly descent to the ground. Top rope routes are <br>
graded in a decimal system. They begin with the number 5 followed by a decimal to the hundredths place. For example, a climb may be rated as a 5.5 or a 5.12. <br>

      <h3>Climbing Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Before you begin rock climbing, you will need your equipment. This equipment will help you to avoid injury and/or death. <br>
<br>
Rock Climbing Shoes: <br>
The first item of equipment you will need is rock climbing shoes. Rock climbing shoes help narrow your feet to keep the force of your weight into one spot. That force helps <br>
you to stand on small rocks, and keep your foot still. <br>
<br>
Harness: <br>
A climbing harness is an object that a climber will wear around their waist and upper legs. It is used to attach a rope to a climber so they can safely climb routes that extend <br>
safe heights. <br>
<br>
Carabiner: <br>
A Carabiner is a clip that will clip onto a climbing harness. The carabiner usually attaches a belay device. Make sure that your Carabiner is capable of supporting human weight. <br>
<br>
Rope: <br>
A rope allows a climber to climb safely beyond safe heights. You need rope that is specific to climbing. Many outdoor supply shops will sell rock climbing rope. <br>
<br>
Belay Device: <br>
A Belay device is a device that holds the rope, and keeps it from slipping out of the belayer's hands. It loops the rope through a series of points, that keep the rope in place. <br>
<br>
Chalk Bag: <br>
A Chalk bag holds chalk to be used on a rock climber's hands. A chalk bag is optional. Chalk helps to dry sweat off of a climber's hands, so that they don't slip. <br>
