                Bouldering is the most accessible of
                all the types of climbing. Boulderingcan be done by yourself and you
                only require climbing shoes. Chalk is
                optional.
                Bouldering involves short routes that
                vary in difficulty. The difficulty range
                is measured by the letter V followed
                by a number. THe lowest rating is a
                "V0" while the highest rating
                is a "V17". Bouldering routes can be
                found in indoor climbing gyms, and
                outdoor climbing routes. An indoor
                climbing gym will usually max out
                around V10. Bouldering requires
                short bursts of energy with very
                dynamic movements. Technique will
                vary depending on difficulty.

            <p class="climbing-top-rope">
                Top rope is a form of climbing that requires two people. One climbs while the other belays. The climber requires climbing shoes, a harness, and a rope.
                The person belaying requires a harness, a rope, a carabiner, and a belay device. Top rope can be found in indoor climbing gyms, and outdoors. A rope is swung over or looped in between
                an object located at the top of the wall. The climber will take the end of the rope that is closer to the wall, while the second person (the belayer), will take the rope closer to them.
                The rock climber will take the rope between a loop (or more, depending on the harness) and tie what is known as a figure 8 knot. The belayer will attach their belay device to their carabiner.
                After which they will guide the rope into their belay device, through the loop (or loops) built into their harness, and finally guide the rope into the other side of their belay device.
                As the climber begins scaling the wall, the rope will begin to slack. As the rope slacks, the belayer will pull their rope through their belay device to tighten the slack. 
                When the climber finishes the route, the belayer will slowly let the rope through the belay device, and the climber will slowly descent to the ground. Top rope routes are
                graded in a decimal system. They begin with the number 5 followed by a decimal to the hundredths place. For example, a climb may be rated as a 5.5 or a 5.12.
