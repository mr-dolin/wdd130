                        <p>Bouldering is the most accessible of all the types of climbing. Bouldering can be done by yourself and you only require climbing shoes. Chalk is optional.
                            Bouldering involves short routes that vary in difficulty. The difficulty range is measured by the letter V followed by a number. The lowest rating is a "V0" while the highest rating
                            is a "V17." Bouldering routes can be found in indoor climbing gyms, and outdoor climbing routes. An indoor climbing gym will usually max out around V10. Bouldering requires
                            short bursts of energy with very dynamic movements. Technique will vary depending on difficulty.</p>

                        <p>Top rope is a form of climbing that requires two people. One climbs while the other belays. The climber requires climbing shoes, a harness, and a rope.
                            The person belaying requires a harness, a rope, a carabiner, and a belay device. Top rope can be found in indoor climbing gyms, and outdoors. A rope is swung over or looped in between
                            an object located at the top of the wall. The climber will take the end of the rope that is closer to the wall, while the second person (the belayer), will take the rope closer to them.
                            The rock climber will take the rope between a loop (or more, depending on the harness) and tie what is known as a figure 8 knot. The belayer will attach their belay device to their carabiner.
                            After which they will guide the rope into their belay device, through the loop (or loops) built into their harness, and finally guide the rope into the other side of their belay device.
                            As the climber begins scaling the wall, the rope will begin to slack. As the rope slacks, the belayer will pull their rope through their belay device to tighten the slack. 
                            When the climber finishes the route, the belayer will slowly let the rope through the belay device, and the climber will slowly descent to the ground. Top rope routes are
                            graded in a decimal system. They begin with the number 5 followed by a decimal to the hundredths place. For example, a climb may be rated as a 5.5 or a 5.12.</p>
