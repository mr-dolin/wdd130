                <h4 class="gear-text-header">Rock climbing shoes:</h4>
                <p>The first item of equipment you will need is rock climbing shoes. 
                    Rock climbing shoes help narrow your feet to keep the force of your weight into one spot. 
                    That force helps
                    you to stand on small rocks, and keep your foot still.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="gear-text-header">Harness:</h4>              
                <p>A climbing harness is an object that a climber will wear around their waist and upper legs. 
                    It is used to attach a rope to a climber so they can safely climb routes that extend
                    safe heights.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="gear-text-header">Carabiner:</h4>
                <p>A Carabiner is a clip that will clip onto a climbing harness. 
                    The carabiner usually attaches a belay device. 
                    Make sure that your Carabiner is capable of supporting human weight.</p>
                <h4 class="gear-text-header">Rope:</h4>
                <p>A rope allows a climber to climb safely beyond safe heights. 
                    You need rope that is specific to climbing. Many outdoor supply shops will sell rock climbing rope.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="gear-text-header">Belay Device:</h4>
                <p>A Belay device is a device that holds the rope, and keeps it from slipping out of the belayer's hands.
                    It loops the rope through a series of points, that keep the rope in place.
                    </p>
                <h4 class="gear-text-header">Chalk Bag:</h4>
                <p>A Chalk bag holds chalk to be used on a rock climber's hands. 
                    A chalk bag is optional. 
                    Chalk helps to dry sweat off of a climber's hands, so that they don't slip.</p>
