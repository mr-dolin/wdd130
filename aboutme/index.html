    <h2>Jared Dolinar</h2>
    <p>Hi friends, I'm Jared Dolinar, and I just finished serving a service mission for the Church.
        I've lived in Utah my entire life, and have been a member of the Church since birth.
        I'm grateful for my mission, and what it has taught me about hard work and serving others.
    </p>
    <p>I have been interested in technology since I was a teenager. My brother helped me build my own computer,
        and I most likely spend an unhealthy amount of time on it, but I try to do better every day.
    </p>
    <p>I'm not sure what path to go, but I love learning about anything related to computers.
        I've struggled with programming before, and I'm hoping to change that through school.
    </p>
    <p>I'm grateful for the opportunity to gain a degree online through BYUI. And I'm excited to learn with you all.</p>
